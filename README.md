guessing-game created by Serina Tsang

guessing-game repository is comprised of index.html, index2.html and index3.html and game.js files:

-index.html file is the guessing game demo demonstrated by our instructor, Scott Schmidt, which introduces introductory prompts and alerts using userName, Hello World, correct names, etc. if/else statements were also introduced.

-index2.html file is my first version of the guessing game which includes 3 guessing-game questions created by me using HTML, Javascript, answer and statement variables, if/else statements, and prompts and alerts. My TA, Brian Ray suggested that I use user inputs when I console.log which leads to index3.html.

-index3.html file is an updated index2.html file using comparison and logical operators, and loop counters. I also paid close attention to grammar, spacing, indentation, etc. Javascript file was also added to make HTML file cleaner by filtering out Javascript onto a separate file which leads to game.js.

-game.js file contains the Javascript portion of index3.html.

UPDATE 1/17/16

-First pair programming exercise: work on a partner's code using a separate branch then push updates/changes to branch, merge branch with master, then pull to master

-Added game functionality by encapsulating functions

-Removed alerts so that answers to questions are on webpage using DOM

-My partner is Stephanie Lopez: https://github.com/sllopez

TROUBLESHOOTING/issues:

-At first I had problems getting the counter to function. It wouldn't count the first question after answering correctly. I resolved this by moving the counter before the alert.

UPDATE 1/17/16

-Continued pair programming exercise by cleaning up functions and fixing layout of alerts in browser window for Stephanie Lopez' guessing game and my game (since we didn't have time to switch driver-navigator roles in lab).
