guessing-game created by Serina Tsang

guessing-game repository is comprised of index.html, index2.html and index3.html and game.js files:

-index.html file is the guessing game demo demonstrated by our instructor, Scott Schmidt, which introduces introductory prompts and alerts using userName, Hello World, correct names, etc. if/else statements were also introduced.

-index2.html file is my first version of the guessing game which includes 3 guessing-game questions created by me using HTML, Javascript, answer and statement variables, if/else statements, and prompts and alerts. My TA, Brian Ray suggested that I use user inputs when I console.log which leads to index3.html.

-index3.html file is an updated index2.html file using comparison and logical operators, and loop counters. I also paid close attention to grammar, spacing, indentation, etc. Javascript file was also added to make HTML file cleaner by filtering out Javascript onto a separate file which leads to game.js.

-game.js file contains the Javascript portion of index3.html.

UPDATE 1/17/16

-First pair programming exercise: work on a partner's code using a separate branch then push updates/changes to branch, merge branch with master, then pull to master

-Added game functionality by encapsulating functions

-Removed alerts so that answers to questions are on webpage using DOM

-My partner is Stephanie Lopez: https://github.com/sllopez

TROUBLESHOOTING/issues:

-At first I had problems getting the counter to function. It wouldn't count the first question after answering correctly. I resolved this by moving the counter before the alert.
